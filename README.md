Slothful Iterables brings the power of Array functions like `filter`, `map`, `forEach` to JavaScript's [iterators and generators ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)

You can now lazily run transformations on data to create powerful stream operations while keeping your server's memory usage low.
